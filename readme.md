This repo contains multiple tools to help with web stuff without installing 3 fucking hundred tons of dependency packages.

## Packages

- ## Analytics Client

	A client for Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel.
	
	Provides typing and importable functions to push events without jumping all the hoops with global `fbq()` and `gtag()`
	
	[ðŸ“¦ npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maddsua/analytics-client)

- ## Logpush Client

	Provides a typescript API to push events to logpush service.

	For now only supabase is supported as it's backend. Pocketbase and standalone SQLite service are planned to be added soon. Like maybe this year xD.
	
	It just works as a remote console and is handy in case you're a cheapass and want to save Cloudflare Workers logs on the free plan ðŸ’€.

	[ðŸ“¦ npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@maddsua/logpush-client)
